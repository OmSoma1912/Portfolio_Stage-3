        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Omnamas Soma and 
        I was born on December 19th, 2007 in the US, 
        New Jersey, New Brunswik. I lived in the states
        for most of my life with my family. That includes 
        my mother (Redacted), father (Redacted) and my sister (Redacted). I studied 
        till 5th grade in the US because we moved to
        India when I was 10. I am currently studying 8th
        grade in Narayana Olmpiad School. My hobbies are to
        play sports, games and videogames. I also like to do
        puzzles and coding. </p>
